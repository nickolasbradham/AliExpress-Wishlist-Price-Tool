# AliExpress-Sales-Updater
Powered by Jsoup: https://jsoup.org/

This utility can help you bulk retrieve price and sale data from whishlists from AliExpress. If you load up a whishlist and copy the page source code into the left box, the program will grab all item and price data from the code and append it to the table on the right.

You can then copy the table data into a spreadsheet program and manipulate it further.
